[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) is launching an @facebook.com email service today. In short: users who opt-in to the service will receive an @facebook.com email address based on their Facebook user name. Messages sent to that address will seamlessly integrate into Facebook chat, messages, etc. Facebook is also launching an updated iPhone app today alongside the product launch.

Andrew Bosworth from Facebook insists that this is not an email service. Rather, it seems that Facebook is attempting to integrate the various communication mediums that people use today (including email) through the existing framework within Facebook. This, combined with filtering technology, is being called the "social inbox" by Facebook.

More information after the product publicly launches.

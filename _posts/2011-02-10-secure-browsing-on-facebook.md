[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) now supports encrypted web access for most parts of its service. Secure browsing (over HTTPS) ensures that web traffic between your computer and Facebook's servers are encrypted for security. Eavesdropping on secure web traffic is much more difficult than clear text web traffic (which constitues most Internet traffic). This type of security is basic policy for the websites of financial institutions as well as other websites where sensitive information is transferred.

To enable secure browsing on Facebook, simply navigate to your account settings. It is located within the Account Security section.

Happy Facebooking.

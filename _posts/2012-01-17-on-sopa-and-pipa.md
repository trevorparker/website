<blockquote>
  <p>Wikipedia and some other web services will be going dark tomorrow in protest of SOPA and PIPA. When that happens, and if you find yourself affected, please take the time to read those bills as well as educated legal interpretations of them. Don't take the media's interpretation (in favor or against) for granted. The best thing you can do is make an effort to understand how they may change the Internet, the most powerful platform for the expression of free speech that has ever existed. Please educate yourself.</p>

June 6 is [World IPv6 Launch day](http://www.worldipv6launch.org/). It comes roughly a year after World IPv6 Day, which ultimately helped raise awareness of [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) implementation. Launch day aims to push real IPv6 connectivity to the masses, with quite a few ISPs and online entities flipping the switch for customers.

To find out if your ISP or favorite online service is participating, head on over to the [Participants](http://www.worldipv6launch.org/participants/) page on the World IPv6 Launch website. For cable Internet subscribers, accessing the IPv6-enabled Internet will probably mean equipment upgrades &mdash; namely, a DOCSIS 3 gateway.

IPv6 is an updated form of the ubiquitous Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). One of the most notable improvements is an addressing scheme that allows for a much larger amount of total devices. This larger address space resolves the imminent issue of IPv4 address exhaustion. Other improvements make dynamic address assignment, multicasting, and router processing more straighforward.

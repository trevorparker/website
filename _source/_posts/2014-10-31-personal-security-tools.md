summary: A list of personal security tools and services that I use. Store and create passwords with 1Password, firewall yourself on unsafe networks with Little Snitch, and enable FileVault full-disk encryption.

Internet security has been a growing interest of mine. The nature of security means that there are numerous ways to protect yourself. So, I thought I'd create and maintain a list of security tools that I like and use on a daily basis.

### 1Password

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword){: target="_blank"} is a password manager that integrates with popular web browsers and allows you to control where the password data is stored. The sensitive passwords and data you store in 1Password are encrypted, and you can unlock that data with one strong password of your choice.

**Why I use it**: I log into many websites and services daily. *A lot*, in fact. It would be impossible for me to remember unique and complex passwords for all of those. 1Password saves me time while allowing me to create strong and unique passwords for everything I log into.

**What you can expect**: Pretty seamless support for logging in to websites from major browsers on your computer, laptop, or mobile device.

### Little Snitch

Some operating systems come with a built-in firewall, but (aside from Linux and BSD) they are usually underwhelming. [Little Snitch](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html){: target="_blank"} is a powerful firewall solution for OS X that is also user-friendly.

**Why I use it**: I use a lot of networked applications on a diverse range of wireless and wired networks. I have a good idea of when I want specific kinds of software to talk to the local network and the Internet, and I know on which networks I feel comfortable allowing that to happen.

**What you can expect**: A complete firewall solution with an excellent UI. If you're coming from one of the typical desktop firewall suites, you'll have just as much power without the terrible user experience.

{: .feature-label .tight }
### DuckDuckGo

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/){: target="_blank"} is an up-and-coming search engine with a strong stance on privacy and loads of features. It may not be a security tool in the strictest sense, but its philosophy aligns with good security awareness.

**Why I use it**: The privacy features are a plus, but my main use for DuckDuckGo is its [productivity enhancements](https://duck.co/help/features){: target="_blank"}. For instance, if I wish to search GitHub for Redis, I simply type `redis !gh` and DuckDuckGo directs my search to GitHub. These [\!Bang commands](https://duck.co/help/features/bangs){: target="_blank"} can be very powerful.

**What you can expect**: DuckDuckGo [doesn't track you](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy){: target="_blank"} and encourages the Internet community at large to [contribute new features](http://duckduckhack.com/){: target="_blank"}.

{: .feature-label #feature-filevault }
### FileVault

Mac OS X ships with seamless full-disk encryption as an option. This provides strong protection of data when your Mac is locked.

**Why I use it**: Full-disk encryption like FileVault allows me some level of assurance that it is reasonably difficult to get at my personal data in the event of laoptop theft, physical access to my device, etc.

**What you can expect**: FileVault will encrypt your drive, and OS X accounts that are allowed to decrypt the drive can do so using their account password.

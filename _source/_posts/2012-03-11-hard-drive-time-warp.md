summary: Reflecting on the price of hard drives in the wake of the 2012 Thailand flooding.
---

The flooding in Thailand which resulted in hard drive shortages last year has undoubtedly been felt by computer enthusiasts and businesses alike.

In June of 2011, I purchased three one-terabyte hard drives for my home NAS. One of those drives has been producing flakey checksums during my weekly [ZFS](http://zfsonlinux.org/) scrub. So, I curiously perused my purchase history on Newegg to remember how much I had paid for them. The three drives totaled just over $200 &mdash; not bad.

Pulling up the drive's [product page](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152185) on Newegg resulted in a gasp (OK, maybe not). The same three drives would cost just shy of $500 today. Incredible.

Word is that supply is slowly getting better, and we'll see drive prices ease back down to more reasonable levels. Depending on how this problem drive behaves, I hope that happens sooner rather than later.

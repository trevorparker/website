Not too long ago Apple announced that the version of Java ported to Mac would now be deprecated. This brought into question the future of Java on Mac OS X.

The worries have subsided now that Apple has announced it is collaborating with Oracle for an implementation of Java SE 7 on Mac OS X. While Oracle will be providing the future versions of Java for Mac, Apple will be contributing a large portion of code, including a 32- and 64-bit Java virtual machine.

More information from [Apple](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/11/12openjdk.html), and on the [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) site.
